    	<p>Outreach is an essential part of our organization. We strive to build a relationship with our surrounding community to foster and promote education within the STEM fields. Our goal is to introduce the concept of engineering and the design process to young students in order to help them build engineering skills from a young age. We hope to inspire more young people to choose a STEM career and share with them how much fun engineering can be!</p>

      <p>In an effort to promote STEM education, our chapter participates in local STEM promotional events, such as the Philadelphia Science Festival, and we host our own events for local high school and middle school students at Drexel. Our chapter also participates in local community service events like Philly spring clean-up day!

	  <p><strong class="blue">TechGirlz: HTML/CSS Workshop</strong><br />
      November 23, 2013<br />
      Drexel SWE hosted an HTML/CSS workshop for middle school girls to have a chance to develop the skills and knowledge to create their own websites. Teams of 3-5 middle school girls worked with a member of SWE to come up with their own ideas for a website and incorporated the key codes they learned from the presentation. Each team was guided through this process by their SWE leader and presented their websites to the other groups and their parents at the end of the session.
     </p>

      <p><strong class="blue">Richard Allen Charter School Science Fair</strong><br />
      May 10, 2013<br />
      Drexel SWE visited Richard Allen Charter School (RACS) to participate in their 6th and 7th grade science fair as judges! The students at RACS prepared posters for their science fair projects with topics ranging from studying which diaper absorbs the most water to the effect of wings on the flight of a paper airplane. Fellow judges included Boeing employees and high school teachers from the area.</p>

      <p><strong class="blue">Engineers’ Week: Introduce a Girl to Engineering</strong><br />
      February 18, 2013<br />
      Drexel SWE introduced high school and middle school girls to the engineering design process and the concept of appropriate technology, which is the utilization of local resources to alleviate a community problem. Teams of 5-6 high school and middle school girls worked with a member of SWE to come up with solutions to global problems such as lack of electricity, water collection, and health care, using appropriate technology. Each team was guided through the design process by their SWE leader and presented their solutions to the other groups at the end of the session.</p>
       
      <p><strong class="blue">Philly Robotics Expo</strong><br />
      April 22, 2013<br />
      The Robotics Expo is an annual event that takes place at Drexel during the Philly Science Festival. Local robotics gurus come and share their robotics projects with students of all ages. Robotics teams from the area presented their final projects and many Drexel research groups presented their research in the field of robotics. At the event, Drexel SWE hosted a table to speak with the young students about engineering. For more information about the Robotics Expo, please visit: http://phillyroboticsexpo.com/</p>
